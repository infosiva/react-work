# Testing Demo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Quick Start

```
npm install
npm start
```

The above commands will install dependencies and start the app. To run tests, run `npm test` on a separate command line. There are no tests written in the master branch.
